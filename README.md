for you to create graphs for data, mathematical functions all in python, we will need to use the matplotlib library, which generates graphs for mathematical situations and with data. importing in su code "from matplotlib import pyplot as plt", passing the library, you already have access to all the tools of that library. code used in the project in the folder at the top of the repository.

there is a whole variety of ways to create graphs using the matplotlib library, also for use with lists, tuples, data analysis, and data structure, we have graphs with levels.
